# QuASAr slim

This repository now follows a library-oriented layout with dedicated folders for
core code, benchmarks, suites, plots, and scripts. For full documentation,
installation instructions, and usage examples see [docs/README.md](docs/README.md).

Quick links:

- Core package: `quasar/`
- Circuit generators: `benchmarks/`
- Suite runners: `suites/`
- Plotting utilities: `plots/`
- Helper scripts: `scripts/`

## Benchmarking from saved thresholds

The `scripts/bench_from_thresholds.py` helper consumes the JSON thresholds
generated by `scripts/playground_cutoff.py --save-json` and reproduces the
benchmark cases with full logging:

```bash
python scripts/bench_from_thresholds.py \
    --thresholds path/to/thresholds.json \
    --out-dir suite_from_thresholds \
    --baseline-timeout-s 1800 \
    --log-level DEBUG
```

Key flags introduced in the latest update:

- `--baseline-timeout-s`: aborts individual baseline simulator runs after the
  configured number of seconds. When a timeout triggers the runner now logs the
  timeout and substitutes analytical runtime and memory estimates so downstream
  plots can still be generated.
- `--log-level`: controls the verbosity of the stage-level timing logs emitted
  by the script (defaults to `INFO`). Use `DEBUG` to inspect where the flow may
  be spending time.
